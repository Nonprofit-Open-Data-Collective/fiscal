\title{Government Grants Ratio}
\usage{
get_ggr(df, ggc, total.revenue, winsorize = 0.98)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing the required field for computing the metric. The metric will be appended to this dataset.}

\item{ggc}{A character string indicating the column name for government grant contributions (On 990: Part VIII, Line 1(E); On EZ: Not Available).}

\item{total.revenue}{A character string indicating the column name for total revenue (On 990: (Part VIII, Line 12A); On EZ: Part I, Line 9).}
}
\value{
The original dataframe appended with the government grants ratio (\code{ggr}),
a winsorized version (\code{ggr.w}), a standardized z-score version (\code{ggr.z}),
and a percentile version (\code{ggr.p}).
}
\description{
Calculate the government grants ratio and append it to the dataframe.
}
\details{
The government grants ratio measures the percentage of an organizationâ€™s revenues that come from
government grants and contributions. High values in this ratio indicate that more of an organization's
revenues come from government grants while a lower number indicates that an organization's funds come from
other donation sources (private foundations), earned income, or investment income.
