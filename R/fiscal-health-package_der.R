#' Debt to Equity Ratio 
#'
#' @description
#' Calculate the debt to equity ratio and append it to the dataframe. 
#'
#' @param debt Total debt, EOY (On 990: Part X, line 17B; On EZ: Not Available).
#' @param equity Unrestricted net assets, EOY (On 990: Part X, line 27B; On EZ: Not Available).
#' @param winsorize The winsorization value (between 0 and 1), defaults to 0.98 which winsorizes at 99th and 1st percentile values.   
#' 
#' @return The original dataframe appended with the debt to asset ratio (`der`), 
#'  a winsorized version (`der.w`), a standerdized z-score version (`der.z`), 
#'  and a percentile version (`der.p`).   
#'
#' @details Debt to Equity Ratio is a a leverage ratio that defines the total amount of debt relative to the unrestricted assets owned by an organization.
#' This metric shows the big picture view of how much an organization owes relative to what it owns. 
#' Higher values mean it is more highly leveraged, meaning it has low capacity for future borrowing. 
#' As an example: if an organization has a total-debt-to-net-assets ratio of 0.4, 40% of its assets 
#' are financed by creditors, and 60% are its own unrestricted, available equity. As this percentage 
#' creeps above the 50% mark, it can call into question the organizationâ€™s ability to manage debt, 
#' which could jeopardize the delivery of programs and services. However, for developers, extremely 
#' low values may mean the organization is not capitalizing enough on its equity to expand.
#' This value can be negative if an organization has either overpaid on its debts or if it has negative 
#' unrestricted net assets.One limitation of this metric is that it does not provide any indication of 
#' asset quality or liquidity since it lumps tangible and intangible assets together.
